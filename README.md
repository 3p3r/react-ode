## re-scaffolding

this project uses [`projen`](https://projen.io/) for scaffolding.

to rescaffold a new empty project like this one, you need [`projen`](https://projen.io/).

copy _only_ the `.projenrc.js` file into a new empty directory and run:

```bash
npx projen
```

This should give you a `.projen` directory and initializes `projen` in your new directory.

Run `npx projen` again to scaffold your new directory exactly like this repository is set up.
